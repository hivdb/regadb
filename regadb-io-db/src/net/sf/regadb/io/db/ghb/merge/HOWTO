NAME: ghb-new

1) import the newly generated patients.xml in db ghb-new
2) import the last patients.xml exported from GHB (the running RegaDB) in ghb-new,
   but since therapies will be merged differently and test results/viral isolates
   are not manualy updated, we have to exclude them from the synching:
	patients.xml
	admin
	admin
	-dont-add Therapy,TestResult,ViralIsolate
	-dont-update Therapy,TestResult,ViralIsolate
	-dont-delete Therapy,TestResult,ViralIsolate

NAME: ghb-new-u

Now we merge the therapies.

Getting the changes form the first version:
1) import the first xml in a new db: ghb0509
2) import the xml exported from GHB in a new db: ghb0901
3) make sure both are merged
	if this query returns rows "select * from patient where not patient_id ~ '^[0-9]*$')"
	then run mergepatients.sh on the db
4) create the therapy diff between the two db's:
	./generate-therapy-diff.sh -e ghb0509 ghb0901
5) run net.sf.regadb.io.db.ghb.MergeTherapies with options:
	ghb0509-ghb0901-all-therapy.diff
	ghb0901 regadb_user regadb_password
	ghb-new regadb_user regadb_password

NAME: ghb-new-um-0901

Repeat this for every period of manual changes between db updates:
ghb0901-upgraded - last export
