PRIORITY
* details pics, generate them during analysis?
* ref seq name is too long
* start form: explain clearly that there are two options to submit a sequence:
  1) Either paste your sequence or sequences below in FASTA format:
     ...
     [Run] [Clear]
  2) Or, upload a FASTA file containing your sequences:
     ...
     [Upload]

  3) If you have submitted a job before, you can use a bookmark to go back, or
     if you have saved the job ID, enter it here:
     ...
     [Go]
* report form: explain that you can bookmark the page at any time, to come back
  to the results later. Indicate how long they are kept (configuration option).

LATER
* WMessage args, WAnchors
  ??
* reference alignment table, add support for *_URL colomn name
* download entire jobDir contents as tar.gz (monitor-form)
  [now is a zip file, that is okay?]
* start form 
	* seq name -> max 20 chars ? (check for this?)
   -> they are truncated, I would not really worry about it. Also stupid characters
      are stripped from them.
* how is dealt with gaps (-) in the input seq (Koen)
   -> they are removed, as they should.
