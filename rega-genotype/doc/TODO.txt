PRIORITY
* details pics, generate them during analysis?
* ref seq name is too long
* report form: Indicate how long results are kept (configuration option).
* check the jobDir whether it exists, if not give an appropriate error message
* google find the subtypetool (meta content)
* HIV/HTLV report bootstrap is not showing
* wrong assignment HTLV

LATER
* WMessage args, WAnchors
  ??
* reference alignment table, add support for *_URL colomn name
* download entire jobDir contents as tar.gz (monitor-form)
  [now is a zip file, that is okay?]
