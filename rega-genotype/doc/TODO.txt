PRIORITY
* details pics, generate them during analysis?
* start form:
   - do not show an uploaded file (firefox hangs doing spell checking on big file)
     I did this but you may want to give it another look
   - show small sample to start with
     > seqname
     ACGTACGGAAACGATACAAGATACAAGATAACA
   - provide error feed back (not just a red background)
* unit test example
* ref seq name is too long
* layout without tables
* layout; goto monitor

LATER
* WMessage args, WAnchors
* make seq limitation configurable
* reference alignment table, add support for *_URL colomn name
* download entire jobDir contents as tar.gz (monitor-form)
* start form 
	* seq name -> max 20 chars ? (check for this?)
* how is dealt with gaps (-) in the input seq (Koen)
