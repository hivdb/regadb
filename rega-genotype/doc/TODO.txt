PRIORITY
* overview analyses details (+ extra comments)
* repository for treepuzzle
* image sizes (f.e. header image -> too small?)
* start form -> seq name -> max 20 chars ?
* start form -> browse for file
* start form -> monitor job (by providing an id)
* recombination plot (cfr mail pong)
* puzzle image -> too much whitespace
* image centering -> sometimes refresh is needed
* test on server without X installed, with java 1.5 (image creation)
* download entire jobDir contents as tar.gz (monitor-form)
* 1000 seqs limitation (only 400 seqs works)
* how is dealt with gaps (-) in the input seq
* write installation doc

LATER
* WMessage args, WAnchors
* make seq limitation configurable
* reference alignment table, add support for *_URL colomn name
